# Health Monitoring System

This project is a **real-time health monitoring web application** built for hackathons. It combines IoT, Machine Learning, and geolocation services to provide users with a comprehensive health monitoring experience.

## Features

- **Live Health Data Dashboard**: Monitors vital signs such as ECG, heart rate, and pulse in real-time from IoT devices or Thingspeak API.
- **ML-Based Risk Prediction**: Uses trained machine learning models to predict potential health risks and diseases based on user sensor data.
- **Nearby Doctors**: Displays nearby doctors with detailed information using maps and geolocation APIs.
- **Interactive Charts and UI**: Beautiful, responsive dashboards for visualizing health data.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Nextjs, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **ML Models:** Python (Flask/FastAPI)
- **Maps & Location:** Google Maps API / OpenStreetMap

## How It Works

1. Health sensor devices send real-time data to the backend or Thingspeak API.
2. The backend fetches data and sends it to the ML model API for risk predictions.
3. Predictions and live readings are displayed on the frontend dashboard.
4. Users can also view nearby doctors for medical assistance.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/health-monitoring-system.git
